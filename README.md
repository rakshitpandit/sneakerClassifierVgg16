# sneakerClassifierVgg16
I have created a Python notebook to classify sneakers using transfer learning with the pre-trained VGG16 model and its pre-trained weights. The training, validation, and testing datasets have been collected from popular e-commerce websites. The pre-trained VGG16 model has been used as a feature extractor, and a custom classifier has been added to the top of the model to train it for the specific sneaker classification task.

The hyperparameters have been tuned after multiple iterations of testing to optimize the performance of the model. The notebook provides step-by-step instructions on how to load the pre-trained VGG16 model and its pre-trained weights, extract the features from the sneaker images, and train the custom classifier using the extracted features.

The model's performance has been evaluated on the testing dataset, and the results have been presented in the notebook. The notebook also provides instructions on how to save the trained model and how to use it to classify new sneaker images.
